If the person who is covered in the policy known as", "the Life Assured, passes away or becomes terminally ill, whichever is earlier, an amount known as the Death Benefit will be paid to the claimant. This gives the family of the Life Assured the comfort of financial safety net to be able to meet future financial goals even if the Life Assured is not around. Under both the plan options provided all due premiums have been paid, the Death Benefit payable to the claimant will be higher of 7 times Annualized Premium, 105% of the Total Premiums Paid up", "to the date of death or of diagnosis of terminal illness, whichever is earlier and Sum Assured opted by you Where, Annualized premium shall be the premium amount payable in a year excluding the taxes, rider premiums, underwriting extra premiums and loadings for modal premiums. Total Premiums Paid means the total of all the premium paid under the base product, excluding any extra premium, and taxes, if collected explicitly. You have the option to choose any one of the two plan options listed", "below. Your premiums and benefits will be determined by the plan option you select. Once chosen, your plan option cannot be changed. 1 With Return of Premium Under this option, in the event of earlier of death or terminal illness of the Life Assured during the policy term, Death Benefit will be paid out as described above as per death benefit payout option. Upon survival of Life Assured till the date of maturity, you will receive a maturity benefit equal to 100% of total premiums paid. In the", "event of death of the Life Assured or where the Life Assured is diagnosed with Terminal Illness on the Date of Maturity then only Maturity Benefit if applicable will be payable and no death benefit shall be payable. Let us understand how this plan option works using illustrations, Mr. Kumar, a 35-year-old male, wants to cover his loved ones with a savings/term plan with sum assured of 2 Crores for 40 years. Mr. Kumar is a salaried professional and his annual income is 25 Lakhs per annum. He", "chooses to pay premiums for 10 years. He maintains a good lifestyle and is a healthy, non-smoker life. Mr. Kumar wants to opt for Return of Premium plan option.

Unlike the previous option, this option does not provide any Maturity Benefit. In the event of death of the Life Assured or where the Life", "Assured is diagnosed with Terminal Illness on the Date of Maturity both Death and Maturity Benefit will not be payable. However, the premiums for this plan option are different from the previous one. Let us say Mr. Kumar from the previous example, now opts for Without Return of Premium option.
