# xInsur AI: Project Overview
## Enterprise Financial Intelligence Framework

**xInsur AI** is a state-of-the-art, regulatory-hardened AI advisory platform designed for Tier-1 financial institutions. It bridges the gap between complex insurance policy documentation and secure, institutional-grade advisory through a deterministic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture.

### 🏛️ Institutional Archetype
The platform is built on the principle of **"Automated Defensibility."** Every action taken by the AI is governed by the Three Lines of Defense:
1.  **Logic Core**: Secure RAG retrieval from verified PDF sources.
2.  **Risk Controls**: Real-time PII scrubbing and Model Risk Guardian validation.
3.  **Audit Integrity**: WORM-compliant, cryptographically chained logging.

---

### 🛡️ Core Stability Pillars
*   **Deterministic Accuracy**: Utilizing Jina AI embeddings and FAISS to ensure all insights are grounded in the `ICICI_Insurance.pdf` repository.
*   **Regulatory Alignment**: Standardized on SR 11-7 (Model Risk Management) and GDPR/DPDP privacy requirements.
*   **Institutional UX**: A high-fidelity, professional interface designed for executive precision and data-dense analysis.

---

### 🏗️ Strategic Architecture
*   **VPC-First Design**: Engineered for local or private cloud deployments to ensure zero data leakage.
*   **Immutable Lineage**: Every response is linked to a specific policy chunk via a unique `TRACE_ID`.
*   **Privacy-by-Design**: Multi-layered PII masking active at the gateway level.
